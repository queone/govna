# Release

Reference for this repo's release ceremony, pre-release checklist, and acceptance test conventions. The enforceable one-liners live in `AGENTS.md`; this document explains the steps and the rationale.

## Release Command

This repo uses `./build.sh vX.Y.Z "release message"` to cut releases. The release path shows `git status --short`, lists every git step it will execute, and prompts for interactive confirmation. On approval it orchestrates `git add → commit → annotated tag → push tag → push branch`.

`build.sh` is self-contained Bash 3.2+ tooling. DOC repositories do not need a compiler toolchain for release preparation or release orchestration and define no automated content-validation command.

DOC release prep remains repository-wide and does not accept CODE target-selection arguments.

Release messages must be 80 characters or fewer.

DOC repositories do not provide installable utilities, so the independent
utility-version declaration and `--version` contract does not apply to this
release path. CODE consumers use the stack-specific adapter and validation
rules in `govna/build-release.md`.

### Build Presentation

- Reuse the canonical build color policy and palette.
- Color release status output by semantic role.
- Emit plain output when stdout is not a terminal.
- Emit plain output when `NO_COLOR` is set.
- Emit plain output when `TERM=dumb`.
- Require a 256-color-capable terminal before emitting ANSI sequences.
- Preserve plain-text content and output streams when color is disabled.
- Keep the self-contained build script compatible with Bash 3.2.

## Acceptance Tests

Every AT in an AC document must be labeled `[Automated]` or `[Manual]`.

- **Automated** — The result can be verified from CLI output, file inspection, or manual review of rendered content. Automated ATs are run during implementation and re-run as part of the pre-release checklist.
- **Manual** — Requires a live end-to-end action and must be confirmed by the user. The agent cannot self-verify these.

Default to Automated whenever the result is verifiable without a live external service. Manual ATs add friction to the release flow, so reserve them for behaviors that genuinely cannot be checked any other way.

Source axis (`[Automated]` / `[Manual]`) names who verifies. Timing axis (`[Pre-release gate]` / `[Post-release verification]`) names when verification happens. `[Pre-release gate]` is the default and may be omitted; `[Post-release verification]` is explicit. Use `[Post-release verification]` only when automated regression coverage already gates pre-release on the underlying class. The label communicates that the AT is a confidence check, not a gate, so future Operators do not promote it back into a gate.

## Pre-Release Checklist (`Package`, `package`, `pack`, or `prep`)

Do not start this checklist unless the director explicitly requests standalone
`Package`, `package`, `pack`, or `prep` in the active Ratified AC context.
Do not treat `./build.sh prep ...` or ordinary build-preparation language as a
workflow request.

1. **Verify all in-scope AC work is complete.** Every AT in the AC has been run and passes.
2. **Determine the version.** Classify the change set using semver: PATCH (formatting, fixes, refactors invisible to users) or MINOR (structure, navigation, schema changes visible to users). Bump from the latest tag accordingly.
3. **Derive the release message.** Summarize the change set in ≤ 80 characters. Lead with the AC reference if any (e.g., `AC1: adopt govna v0.1.0 DOC overlay`).
4. **Run release prep.** Run `./build.sh prep vX.Y.Z "derived message"`. It inserts the CHANGELOG row, deletes completed AC files referenced by the release message, sweeps their `plan.md` IE entries, and prints the release command. Use `--dry-run`/`-n` to inspect without writes.
5. **Present the release command.** Print the exact command emitted by prep for the director to run:

```
./build.sh vX.Y.Z "derived message"
```

The agent never runs the release command — only the director does. Do not add trailing commentary after presenting the command. The director already knows.

## CHANGELOG Conventions

- File shape: `# Changelog` heading, then a 2-column markdown table (`| Version | Summary |` with a `|---------|---------|` separator); first data row is `| Unreleased | |`, followed by one row per release (e.g., `| <version> | <AC-ref>: <one-line summary> |`).
- During an audit adoption cycle, the `| Unreleased | |` row's Summary column may carry preserve marker phrases (per `govna/audit.md` `## Preserve-marker phrase set`).
- Summaries are single-line, ≤ 500 characters; lead with the AC reference if any.
- Versions are unprefixed (`0.29.0`, not `v0.29.0`).
- Do not backfill historical tags or invent alternative shapes (Keep-a-Changelog, sectioned `## vX.Y.Z`, etc.).
- When an AC locks a local form against canon (preserves a customization, declares intentional divergence, blocks a sync), include an explicit `preserve <path> <qualifier>` phrase in the summary — `govna audit` recognizes this phrase set: `preserve <path>`, `do not sync <path>`, `intentional divergence: <path>`, `<path>: keep local`.
