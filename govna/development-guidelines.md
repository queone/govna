# Development Guidelines

Use these durable coding practices; use `AGENTS.md`, `development-cycle.md`, and `build-release.md` for workflow, validation, and Package.
Sections above ## Project Practices are govna-maintained canon and update via canon syncs; repo-specific practices in ## Project Practices.

## Identifier Strategy

- Choose a primary key strategy early and document it in `arch.md`
- Prefer surrogate keys for internal identity; keep external IDs as indexed attributes
- When integrating multiple external ID systems, maintain an explicit mapping layer rather than assuming IDs are interchangeable

## Schema And Data Migrations

- Treat schema changes as first-class events: version them, document them, test the migration path
- Never assume old data fits new schemas — write migration logic or fail explicitly
- When a migration changes identity or key structure, audit all foreign key references in the same change

## External Integration Patterns

- Validate external data at the boundary; do not trust upstream shape or completeness
- When reconciling data from multiple sources, define a clear precedence order and document it
- Cache external data locally with explicit TTL or versioning; never silently serve stale data as fresh

## Generated Artifact Propagation

- When source-of-truth code is duplicated into templates or rendered examples, fixes must propagate to all copies in the same change
- Grep the full repo for the pattern being changed before considering a fix complete
- If a template and its rendered output diverge, the template is authoritative
- Keep `build.sh` self-contained; do not add sourced production helper modules.
- Propagate stack build behavior through the affected template under `templates/overlays/code/stacks/`.

## Error Handling And Validation

- Validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs, file I/O); trust internal code
- Fail explicitly rather than silently degrading — a clear error is better than wrong output
- Static analysis and linting errors are build failures, not warnings
- Validate installable-target declarations before compiling or installing them.
- Follow the applicable stack guidance for release-prep evidence, validation ordering, and build-state reuse.
- Pass release-prep evidence through the applicable stack's canonical CLI option.

## Testing Expectations

- Test every new function and error path in the implementation pass.
- If a code path cannot be tested without mocking infrastructure that is out of scope, document the coverage gap explicitly rather than silently skipping it
- Label tests that require live systems or manual verification as `[Manual]`

## Dependency And Import Hygiene

- Prefer standard library over external dependencies when the capability is equivalent
- When adding a dependency, justify it — convenience alone is not sufficient
- Keep import paths consistent after renames or reorganizations

## CLI Usage Formatting

- All commands must accept `-h`, `-?`, and `--help` as help flags
- Help output uses a shared formatting function for consistent layout
- "Usage:" is rendered in bold white
- Each flag line is indented 2 spaces; descriptions align at column 38
- Short and long flag forms are combined on one line (e.g. `-v, --verbose`)
- When adding new flags, add the entry to the shared usage formatter — do not rely on framework defaults

## Documentation Alignment

- Ship behavior docs with code, verify every referenced symbol or path, and keep `arch.md` limited to built architecture.

## Rust Practices

- Run all repository validation through `./build.sh`.
- Declare every installable Cargo binary with an explicit literal `[[bin]]` name and path.
- Declare exactly one literal `PROGRAM_VERSION: &str` strict stable SemVer value in each declared binary path.
- Print exactly `<utility-id> <MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH>` or `<utility-id> v<MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH>` plus its newline for `--version` with no stderr output.
- Validate every utility declaration before compilation.
- Validate each compiled utility before installing it.
- Validate every compiled utility before writing release metadata.
- Use space-separated binary names for scoped builds.
- Keep selected target order deterministic under the byte locale.
- Keep Cargo compilation artifacts in the build-managed temporary target.
- Reject a bare `cargo build`, `cargo check`, `cargo test`, or `cargo clippy` invocation outside `./build.sh`.
- Pass an explicit `--target-dir` outside the repository for any diagnostic or corrective `cargo` exception.
- Validate formatting and shared library code package-wide during scoped builds.
- Limit binary checks, matching integration tests, release artifacts, and installation to selected targets.
- Install all Cargo binary targets with tracked installation during a full build.
- Install selected Cargo binaries with `--no-track --force` during a scoped build.
- Preserve unselected installed binaries and Cargo tracking metadata during scoped installation.
- Install binaries only during successful full builds and post-change release validation.
- Skip binary installation during fallback pre-change validation.
- Reject `--no-build` release prep when independent utility validation is required.
- Emit a Git-visible-state validation token after each successful full build.
- Pass current validation evidence to release prep through `-t, --validation-token`.
- Retain `GOVNA_PREP_VALIDATION_TOKEN` only as a compatibility fallback.
- Refresh validation evidence only after an exact baseline-only audit-adoption transition.
- Run fallback pre-change validation only when evidence is missing or stale.
- Run post-change validation package-wide.
- Reuse one prep-owned Cargo target throughout Rust release prep.
- Set `CARGO_HOME` to an external path when isolating binary installation.
- Resolve installed-binary name conflicts before rerunning the build.
- Format Rust code with rustfmt.
- Treat Clippy warnings as build failures.
- Test all targets and all features before handoff.
- Document public Rust items with rustdoc comments.
- Return contextual errors instead of discarding error sources.
- Confine `unsafe` code to the smallest practical scope.
- Document the safety invariant for every `unsafe` block.
- Prefer the standard library when it provides equivalent capability.
- Justify every added crate in the governing AC.
- Pin direct dependencies to explicit compatible versions in `Cargo.toml`.
- Keep `Cargo.lock` tracked for application repositories.

## Project Practices

- Follow existing repo patterns unless an approved improvement says otherwise.
